Required software:

  - Python 3.6 (possible lower versions of 3.x -- I haven't tested)
  - make
  - the following Python packages:
      scipy:       pip install scipy
      matplotlib:  pip install matplotlib
      pytest:      pip install pytest
      coverage:    pip install pytest-cov

      
Running SpecGen:

A sample program is included that produces speciation diagrams
for the FeOH3 system, as well as the CO2 system.  To run this 
program use 'make prog'.  This will produce 2 png files (one
for each system).


Running tests:

The test suite can be run using 'make test'.
